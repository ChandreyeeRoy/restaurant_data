# restaurant_data
 Here I am exploring the opendataset on restaurants provided by kaggle. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-restaurant-customer-satisfaction-dataset/data .
I have tried logistic regression on both the numerical and categorical covariates to predict Satisfaction level.
